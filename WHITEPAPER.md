# The Official 67 Coin ($67) – Whitepaper

## Summary
The Official 67 Coin ($67) is the tokenized form of the global 67 phenomenon — a meme, a gesture, and a signal that spread organically across countries, languages, and age groups.

The 67 hand gesture and emote is used everywhere, from schools and gaming communities to professional sports and mainstream social media. The movement has been viral for over a year and continues to grow, which is why many in the community describe 67 as having one of the strongest meme mindshares in digital culture.

### Cultural Recognition

- Recognized by major meme-tracking platforms  
- Referenced across global media and social platforms  
- Adopted organically by creators, gamers, and online influencers  
- Referenced across crypto exchanges and blockchain ecosystems  

$67 is a community-driven cultural participation token on Solana. It is not a coin trying to manufacture culture — the meme came first, the movement came first, and the token is how people choose to participate on-chain.
