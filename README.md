The Official 67 Coin ($67) - Whitepaper
Summary
The Official 67 Coin ($67) is the tokenized form of the global 67 phenomenon: a meme, a
gesture, and a signal that spread organically across countries, languages, and age groups. The
6 7 hand gesture and emote is used everywhere, from schools and gaming communities to
professional sports and mainstream social media. The movement has been viral for over a year
and continues to grow, which is why many in the community describe 67 as having the biggest
mindshare of any meme in history.
